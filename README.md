This project was developed as part of the seminar "Network Systems for Music Interactions" instructed by Henrik von Coler at TU Berlin (2021). It offers an approach to the sonification of a livechat consisting only of emojis. The sound a new message/an emoji creates varies depending on the sentiment they carry. The sentiment scores for this project are taken from "Sentiment of Emojis" (Novak et al. 2015).

The participants are sending emojis to a chat.

They created a sentiment lexikon for the 751 most frequently used emojis by analyzing messages from Twitter. 
It turns out that most of the emojis have a positive effect in messages, especially the most popular ones.
